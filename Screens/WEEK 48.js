        KEYS TO SIGN AND WONDERS{"\n"}{"\n"}
        MAIN POINT FROM THE PASSAGE {"\n"}{"\n"}</Text>
        1: Every door has a key that unlocks it. So also signs and wonders have keys that open them (Isaiah 22:22). Whatever God does is for a purpose and there is also time for signs and wonders (eer 3:1). This is the essence of todayâ€™s lesson. May signs and wonder be our experience even as we learn at the name of Jesus Christ.{"\n"}{"\n"}
        2: What is signs and wonder? Signs are a token, eer or eer of remarkable event/supranational intervention. Exo. 3:12, Isa 7:4. Wonder is a product of miracle which causes grate astonishment Mark 2:10-12, Act 3:6-10.{"\n"}{"\n"}
        3: Why do we need signs and wonders? Devil and demons have wreaked great torment, abnormal behavior and captivity upon man. Mark 5:25. Signs and wonders propel people to believe the gospel. God confirms the calling of his ministers through signs and wonder Psalm 104:4 Mark 6:17-18{"\n"}{"\n"}
        4: Keys to signs and wonders{"\n"}{"\n"}
