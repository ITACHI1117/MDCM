        MAIN POINT FROM THE PASSAGE {"\n"}{"\n"}</Text>
        1. According to the Merriam Websterâ€™s dictionary, a child is a young person especially
between infancy and youth. Child abuse is any maltreatment of a child which causes
him/her harm. Such action can also take the form of child neglect and failure to protect
a child from danger especially by a parent or other care giver. The bible does not use
the word abuse but tells us that whosoever harms a child is asking for God's anger (Mark
9 v 42).{"\n"}{"\n"}
  2. God places high premium on children (Math 10 v 13 to 14). He assures them of his
kingdom (Math 10 v 14 to 16). He compares children as the arrows in the hand of the
might (Psalm 127 v 4){"\n"}{"\n"}
  3. Child abuse can be in form of physical abuse, sexual abuse and emotional/
psychological abuse (1 kings 3 v 19, 1kings 3 v 25 to 26, Mark 9 v 42, 2 Samuel 13 v
10 to 15, 1samuel 17 v 26 to 28){"\n"}  {"\n"}
